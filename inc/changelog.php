developer's own reference, but it's public so everyone can see what is going
on behind the scenes at LCWO. Some things may not make much sense to anyone but
the author.

    * Firefox does not allow auto-playing sound any more (without a click
      or tap by the user). In word training, callsign training and Morse
      Machine, this resulted in errors because the keyboard focus started
      in an entry field and pressing enter here did not work. Moving the

      (still no click/tap needed, only pressing enter while the button is
      in focus works).

    * Fix y axis label positions / spacing (no more overlap with axis)
